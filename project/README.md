This is Project 3. There was not much time to work on this project as much as
I wanted but this is still a useful toy. Pressing the four bottom buttons will
result in something different in the LED screen.

SWITCH 1: Pressing this button will display "hello" in the 8x12 font and
present a small pentagon shape that I created.
SWITCH 2: Pressing this button will only display the "hello" message with the
8x12 font.
SWITCH 3: This will display the screen with a green color only.
SWITCH 4: This will display the pentagon shape I created only but in a much
larger form.

(NOTES): Type "make load" to start the program!
